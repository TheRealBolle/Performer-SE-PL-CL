# Micromac Performer SE/Plus/Classic Clone
  
This is a recreation of the Macintosh SE/30 logicboard.  
It is not a 1:1 copy of the original logicboard but instead the original schematics were used to completely redesign and route a lookalike board.

# Reverse engineered GALs
  
The original GALs have been dumped. GAL16V8-15 as well as PALCE16V8-15 have been tested as suitable replacement.
Faster/slower chips as well as ATF16V8 of any speed haven't been tested so far.

U3, U4, U5 and U6 are mandatory. U7 is only needed for operation in Macintosh Plus and Classic.
Close SJ2 if U7 isn't installed. SJ2 HAS to be open when U7 is installed.
